# Roblox Chess Script

# ⚠️ THIS SCRIPT IS FOR SYNPASE X ONLY ⚠️
---
## This was made using Stockfish for NodeJS
---
## ⚠️ STOCKFISH TYPE ⚠️
If you have an old CPU then change the path for stockfish in the 'index.js' file to 'stockfish-compatibility/stockfish.exe' else make it 'stockfish-latest/stockfish.exe'
---
## ⚠️ Hardware Power To Give Stockfish ⚠️
In 'index.js' you will see 'Hash' and 'Threads', Hash is the amount of RAM you want to use (Do 1024 x <GB of RAM to use>). Threads are the threads in your CPU you can see this in Task Manager
  
### Windows 10
- Go to the Performance tab then look at 'Logical Processors', change 'Threads' to the amount you want to use (MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ATLEAST 4 OR 5 THREADS LEFT)

### Windows 11
- It is pretty much the exact same thing in Windows 11. It just looks a bit different

### First Time
- Open command prompt and navigate to the folder the files are stored in using 'cd "PATH OF FOLDER"'
